## I Am Building a Search Engine  
Exactly what it sounds like: I am building an engine to search the internet and find relevant content.  

## Why  
- LLM chatbots will always require search to fetch up-to-date information.  
- LLMs will soon become the primary method people use to find information.  
- AI labs and companies building UIs for chatbots don't want to build their own search engines.  
- The types of queries an LLM makes are very different from those of a person. Current search engines aren't suited for longer, more detailed queries.  
- It's much easier to build a search engine now than it was a decade ago (thanks to improved software and cloud infrastructure).  
- The best way to rank pages is by using AI. Legacy search engine algorithms and research will soon be obsolete.  
- In the medium term, it will be possible to take on Google. They may face restrictions against making their engine the default. Their results are subpar, and their management is out of touch.  
- We can benefit from all the investment in AI without directly competing with AI labs (GPUs, AI training software).  

## How  
- Raise a seed round from reputable VCs, and/or apply to YC Spring 2025.  
- Initially focus on a niche (e.g., software development, medicine, law).  
- Make the engine available to developers to include in their AI chatbot projects.  
- This enables the development of AI UIs with smaller models that can fetch relevant information on demand.  
- After demonstrating the viability of this concept, scale to a full-blown search engine.  

## Technical  
### Work in Progress (Open to Ideas)  
- Start with Common Crawl (CC). No need to crawl the entire internet ourselves.  
- Filter it for our chosen domain, using <1% of the total dataset.  
- Embed each page.  
- Classify each page into various subcategories (e.g., Python programming, maritime law, high blood pressure).  
- At search time, classify the query and search relevant categories using embeddings and possibly other ranking algorithms.  
- Provide access via an API.  
- As the project scales, start crawling important sites in our niche (since CC updates only monthly).  

## Me  
- I have been validating ideas for the last few months; this is the first idea I really want to pursue.  
- I just quit my job and am moving to SF to raise money and find cofounder(s).  
- I can code and have experience developing and deploying ML models (not just fine-tuning via a library).  
- I was awarded an Emergent Ventures grant by Tyler Cowen to work on LLMs.  
- Previous experience includes working as an ML engineer, biochemist, and active-duty military vet (paratroopers).  

## You  
- Should be willing to relocate to SF in a few months, conditional on us receiving funding (at least temporarily).  
- Be willing and able to take on the role of CTO and lead the technical effort (I will help you).  
- Ideally have experience working with large datasets, ML, and distributed systemsâ€”or be willing to learn.
