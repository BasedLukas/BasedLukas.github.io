## Executive Summary
getdelv is a search engine designed for use by LLMs and AI agents. AIs require a source of up-to-date information and documentation — we provide it.

Our initial focus is on coding-related queries. Our API gives AIs a programming knowledge base they can query, allowing them to use smaller models that excel in reasoning rather than memorizing large amounts of outdated information. Once successful, we will expand into other fields, ultimately scaling into a comprehensive search engine.

Here is a demo showing how our product integrates with Claude desktop to improve coding performance:

We are currently in the very early stages of building the company and validating our idea in the market. Full time work commenced in March 2025.

## Market Opportunity
Current AI coding systems face the following limitations:
- Models are very large and expensive to run because they store data in their weights
- API references, bug reports, and documentation changes daily, making models quickly outdated
- Obscure information isn't retained in training even by the biggest models

As a result, generating logically simple code often fails due to lack of background information. Existing search engines don't adequately address this problem because:
- Additional tooling is required to make them integrate well with applications/agents such as MCP servers etc
- They don't return information-dense results, instead prioritizing user-friendly websites with ads
- They return long lists of links rather than the concise paragraphs of text that models need
- They're expensive and slow because they index the entire internet

### Strategic Timing

The current **challenge** is identifying ideas that benefit from AI growth without:
- Competing against big AI labs
- Being a thin wrapper around a model
- Being undermined by future advancements in AI

A search engine is **ideal** because:
- Growth in LLM usage directly benefits us
- Hardware and software improvements make it feasible to build a search engine with a shoestring budget and small team
- AI tooling is taking off (MCP servers, Agents etc.)

## Our Users and Revenue Model

Our target customers are companies building AI agents and AI-powered software, including:
- Code assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Tabnine, Codeium)
- AI-powered development platforms (Replit, Lovable)
- Internal developer tooling teams

These companies collectively serve millions of users today, likely many more in the near future. Most charge approximately $20 per month to individual users, with enterprise plans costing significantly more. This represents hundreds of millions (if not more) in monthly revenue across the market.

Any product that measurably improves the performance of these tools delivers substantial value, justifying integration costs. Competitors charge $5-$25 per thousand requests (CPM), at a competitive rate of $1 CPM, our engine could process tens of millions of users monthly, generating millions in MRR as we scale.

The strategic value of our specialized search capability also positions us as a potential acquisition target for these same companies seeking to improve their AI assistants' accuracy and capabilities.

## Competition
- **Brave Search API**: Provides general-purpose search and returns lists of links. Used by Mistral, Perplexity, Cohere, and others.
- **Exa.ai**: Modern AI-first search platform focused on querying the internet like a database, used for generating datasets like sales prospects.
- **Perplexity**: Returns text generated by an LLM on the fly, but is expensive and slow.
- **Tavily**: Search API designed for use with LLMs. New entrant.

### Our Competitive Advantage
Our unique advantage stems from our specialized focus on coding:

- **Optimized Processing**: Due to the smaller number of pages we index, we can pre-process and store cleaned, curated text results in our database. This allows us to return high-quality text very quickly, an approach that's unfeasible for general search APIs.

- **Cost Efficiency**: Our specialized coding search covers less than 1% of internet pages, dramatically reducing storage, bandwidth, and compute costs.

- **Superior Performance**: Our focused index enables us to use algorithms that would be impractical for full-scale search engines. We can afford to process every page through an LLM to generate high-quality metadata, yielding much better results for coding queries.

### Marketing Strategy
- **Developer-First Approach**: By focusing on coding, we gain direct access to developers—who will ultimately decide which search APIs to integrate as we expand.

- **Open Source Components**: We'll make subsets of our database open source. For specific tech stacks, developers can access our database and search engine for free, increasing adoption.

## Progress and Timelines
**Jan and Feb 2025**: Initial idea. Founder was still employed elsewhere.
**March 2025**: Full time work commences.

The coding work is already underway. This document will be updated with details shortly.

We are currently focused on validating our product in the market. We are reaching out to potential customers to get feedback on our idea and iterate as necessary. We hope to have a (very limited) MVP out by April/May 2025 and a more widely useful product by end of Q2 2025.

## Founder

I previously worked as an ML engineer, building data pipelines, training models, and deploying them to production. The company I worked for specializes in creating recommendation systems for books by analyzing their content using ML models. I received an Emergent Ventures grant from Tyler Cowen for my work on LLMs. My academic background is in biochemistry and microbiology, and I served in the military, passing paratrooper selection and serving on active duty. I’m a highly competitive amateur athlete, having won bronze at nationals.
