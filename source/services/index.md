# My services

I am usually available for software and machine learning consulting. My strengths lie in model development, databases and data engineering pipelines and backend infra. I can also do limited full stack and front end work.

- Python with common ML libs such as pytorch.
- Time series forecasting, natural language processing and statistical modeling expertise.
- Databases, expertise with complex relational DB schemas, analytics systems as well as document DBs. Have performed complex migrations and access control.
- Devops, terraform, airflow, remote servers.
- Front end, TS, React
- I use LLM tools extensively with thorough supervision.

My rates are quite reasonable because I prioritize the type of work I do and having a lot of personal freedom. I only accept jobs that allow me to do unrushed, thorough work. You can reach me at info@loreley.one
